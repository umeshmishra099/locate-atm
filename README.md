# Overview

Create a Java web application based on the standard servlet spec
The web application should provide a REST api to create a list of ING ATMs in a given Dutch city and return a well formed JSON response
The web application should invoke an external service to gather a super set of the data:  https://www.ing.nl/api/locator/atms/
Create a page that shows the list of ING ATMs
Use Spring and Maven. If you do not have experience in these frameworks, please feel free to use an alternative.

## Bonus features
Use of Apache Camel to route the web service call
